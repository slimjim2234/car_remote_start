# car_remote_start
Create a remote stater using the NextThing C.H.I.P., an amateur circuit design, and an old jeep.

# Details
I have been inspired by two individuals who have successfully been able to remote start their car
Toyota: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S35wm6QAC8g
Jeep: http://gunscarstech.com/2015/08/15/okay-google-start-the-jeep/

As already mentioned above, mysetup is comprised of a:
 * Xpresskit dball2 (key immobilizer bypass module)
 * NextThing's C.H.I.P. https://getchip.com/
 * Sainsmart 5v 4 channel relay
 * custom circuit that converts 3.3v gpio from the CHIP to 5v

# Goals
* Turn on and monitor my car from anywhere in the world
* Monitor my car's status by sniffing the J1850 line
* Learn everything!!!
